# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
Daily-Planner is a schedule, or plan, tracker to organize a user's daily work schedule.
The user is able to enter content for average work hours between 9AM and 5PM.
At the top of the display, the user will be able to see the current day and date.
The content will reset from one day to the next. Meaning that if a user enters scheduled items for Saturday, June 21st, then those scheduled items will be removed by Sunday, June 22nd.
If a user enters content and saves it, but then decides to remove said plan from their schedule, a user can make the text area empty and it will remove the previously saved item from the schedule list.
